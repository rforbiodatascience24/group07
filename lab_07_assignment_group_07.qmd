## **Loading**

The following loads the data set and the packages used throughout this code. It assumes that the packages loaded are already installed.

```{r}

library("tidyverse")
library("readr")

nba_data <- read_csv("~/projects/lab07_git_exercises/data/_raw/nba_2017_nba_players_with_salary.csv")
```

## Organizing the data

We only wish to look at a few of the statistics for our PCA, specifically FG%, 3P%, 2P%, FT% and POINTS.

```{r}
nba_clean <- nba_data |>
  as_tibble()

nba_selected <- nba_clean |>
  select("FG%",
         "3P%",
         "2P%",
         "FT%",
         "POINTS")
```
